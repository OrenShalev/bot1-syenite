# 🤖 bot1-syenite
Bot that reads RSS feeds and publishes items as tweets. [Here](https://twitter.com/irrelevant_il)'s one of the Twitter accounts run by this project.

## 🎩 Description
When triggered by an http/s request, reads an RSS feed, and tweets an item from it if the feed contains an item (or items) which were not tweeted before.

RSS feed items are checked by publication date and the first non-tweeted item is tweeted. 

## 🐭 Motivation
I wanted to read new items from ["Irrelevant" (לא רלוונטי)](https://irrelevant.org.il/) soon after they are published. While an RSS feed is available, I open my RSS reader rarely. On the other hand, I open Twitter regularly so getting new items in my Twitter feed would work perfectly.

Also, it's a nice exercise with several aspects of development I did not get a chance to try before.

## 📚 Name
To POC a few aspects of this bot, I first created bot0-damaya ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bot0_damaya), [GitHub](https://github.com/OrenShalev/bot0-damaya), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/bot0-damaya)).

Damaya and Syenite are characters in the first book of the wonderful trilogy ["The Broken Earth"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B01947LZ8A)
